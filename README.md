# 📊 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on Customer Churn Dataset  

## 🔥 Project Overview  
This project focuses on **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** of a **Customer Churn Dataset** using **Python, Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, and Seaborn**. The goal is to analyze customer behavior, identify churn patterns, and gain insights into factors influencing customer retention.  

## 📂 Dataset Information  
The dataset contains the following key columns:  
- `customerID`: Unique ID for each customer  
- `gender`: Male/Female  
- `SeniorCitizen`: 0 (No) / 1 (Yes)  
- `Partner`: Whether the customer has a partner (Yes/No)  
- `Dependents`: Whether the customer has dependents (Yes/No)  
- `tenure`: Number of months the customer has stayed  
- `Contract`: Month-to-Month / One Year / Two Years  
- `PaymentMethod`: Credit Card, Electronic Check, Mailed Check, etc.  
- `Churn`: Yes (customer left) / No (customer stayed)  

## 📊 Key Findings  
✔ **Churn Rate**: **26.5%** of customers churned  
✔ **Contract Type Impact**: Month-to-month contracts have **55% churn**, whereas long-term contracts have significantly lower churn  
✔ **Payment Method Impact**: Customers using electronic checks have the **highest churn rate**  
✔ **Fiber Optic Users**: Higher churn compared to DSL customers  

## 🛠️ Tech Stack  
- **Python** 🐍  
- **Pandas & NumPy** for data manipulation  
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn** for visualizations  
- **Jupyter Notebook** for analysis
